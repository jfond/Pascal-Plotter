# Pascal-Plotter
Plots the number of rows of pascal's triangle so that the values of each number corresponds to the height of a block on a surface.

Included is an image shown for 100 rows of pascal's triangle. In this image it is visible that pascal's triangle approaches the form of a gaussian as the number of rows N -> Infinity.
